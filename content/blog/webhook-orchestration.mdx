Webhooks keep downstream systems informed. Modern API Gateway provides a complete webhook management experience:

- **Subscriptions** for tenant, consumer, deployment, and policy events.
- **Delivery policies** with exponential backoff, dead-letter queues, and replay tooling.
- **Secret rotation** with HMAC signatures and automatic expiry reminders.
- **Observability** through delivery logs, Prometheus metrics, and alert hooks.

Use the Admin Console to create endpoints, rotate keys, and inspect payloads. Automation teams can do the same through REST APIs or Terraform modules.
