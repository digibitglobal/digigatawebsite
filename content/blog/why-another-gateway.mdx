summary: "A programmable, secure gateway tailored for platform teams."

Building a gateway that treats security, policy, and observability as first‑class concerns lets platform teams move faster with confidence. Modern API Gateway focuses on:

- OAuth2/JWT + optional mTLS
- RBAC/ABAC policy
- Redis‑backed rate limits
- Prometheus metrics
- OpenAPI validation

We prioritize clear configuration, predictable performance, and strong multi‑tenant boundaries.
