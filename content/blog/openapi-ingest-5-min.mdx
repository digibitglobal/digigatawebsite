OpenAPI request/response validation is built into the middleware. Start by enabling it in configuration, then iterate on schemas to catch issues before they hit upstream services. Import/normalization is labeled Beta/Roadmap while we finish automation.

```yaml
OpenAPI:
  enabled: true
  strict_response_validation: true
```
