summary: "How Modern API Gateway handles secure, observable gRPC traffic."
---

Modern API Gateway treats gRPC as a first-class citizen. Define a gRPC API, list its services, and the gateway will proxy streaming traffic with the same policy stack as REST.

### Highlights

- **mTLS everywhere** – supply custom CA bundles, enforce client certificates, and rotate credentials via the Admin Console.
- **Per-method rate limiting** – attach quotas to individual RPCs or entire services.
- **Reflection aware** – enable service reflection for toolchains, or disable it in production.
- **Observability built-in** – Prometheus metrics, trace propagation, circuit breaker analytics, and correlation IDs.
- **Hybrid routing** – mix gRPC and REST for the same upstream, sharing identity and policy contexts.

Configuration lives in `config.yaml` or via the Admin Console designer, letting you add grpc:// or grpcs:// upstreams alongside REST, GraphQL, and aggregation rules.
