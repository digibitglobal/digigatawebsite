title: "Deployment Pipelines: Preview to Production"
date: "2025-02-26"

summary: "Use the Admin Console or API to promote definitions through preview → staged → promoted environments."
---

Every API change flows through a managed pipeline:

1. **Preview** – import or design a definition, run linters, and share with reviewers.
2. **Staged** – execute automated smoke tests, verify contract compatibility, and warm caches.
3. **Promoted** – roll out gradually with weighted routing, monitor metrics, and auto-roll back on failure.

Approvals, notifications, and audit logs are all tracked in the Admin Console. The same workflow can be automated via CLI or CI/CD using our deployment APIs.
