summary: "A guided tour of the 144-page management console powering Modern API Gateway."

The Admin Console is the operational heart of Modern API Gateway. It combines onboarding workflows, a visual API definition designer, deployment orchestration, observability dashboards, and compliance tooling.

## Key areas

- **Onboarding** – create organizations, assign plans, seed demo upstreams, and run checklists.
- **Definition designer** – craft REST, GraphQL, and gRPC routes with transformations, aggregation jobs, and policy previews.
- **Deployment lifecycle** – preview → staged → promoted with approvals, smoke tests, and rollback automation.
- **Operations hub** – monitor rate limits, circuit breakers, webhook deliveries, and consumer activity in real time.
- **Compliance** – audit trails, feedback centre, billing exports, and session management.

Admin Console access is scoped via RBAC/ABAC. Delegated administrators can manage their tenant without touching other organizations.

We are releasing Storybook demos, video walkthroughs, and a public roadmap for console modules. Join the design partner programme for early previews.
