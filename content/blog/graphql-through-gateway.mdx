summary: "Proxy upstream GraphQL with policy and observability."

Modern API Gateway proxies upstream GraphQL services (see `fx-graphql/`). You can:

- Control persisted query headers
- Toggle introspection in production
- Enforce auth/policy before forwarding

This keeps GraphQL consistent with your broader platform controls.
